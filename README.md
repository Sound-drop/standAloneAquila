Purpose
-------

This is an example of how to use CMake to build C++ executables
that link to [Aquila DSP library](http://aquila-dsp.org/).

Prerequisites
-------------

Download, compile and install the library as
[described here](http://aquila-dsp.org/download/). On Linux, this usually
creates a static library `libAquila.a` and installs it to `/usr/local/lib/`.
